# React mini charts

A collection of tiny chart components for React projects. Written with TypeScript and CSS modules.

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

You can start editing and preview your changes with Storybook:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

### Building & publishing

Build the project to generate the output in `/dist`:

```shell
npm run build
```

Bump the version in `package.json`, re-install via `npm install` and then publish to npm (you might need to log in first):

```shell
npm publish
```

### Other commands

```shell
# Format all files according to Prettier config:
npm run format

# Run all tests (none added yet):
npm test
```
